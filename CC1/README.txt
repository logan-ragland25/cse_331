Logan Ragland CC1 Self Report:

My code was able to pass all 7 test cases; none failed. I initially considered creating 
every combination of coin values and storing them in a list, then seeing the smallest value not present.
However, after I thought about this, I realized it was extremely inefficient, had poor time complexity, and would
be difficult to implement. Since this approach would not work, I read the approach guides "Develop the Algorithm" section
to devise a new plan. I did not notice the code directly underneath this, yet happened to implement a very similar solution.
